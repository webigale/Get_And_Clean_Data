Please refer to the README.txt and features_info.txt files in the original zipped file for a full description of the original dataset. Please note that this file contains a header row.

The first two columns were created from the subject and y files in the original data set. The remaining columns are each numeric fields that contain the calculated mean for each subject for each activity for the column of the same name in the X file for the original data set.

subject - integer - Identifies the subject who performed the activity; range is from 1 to 30

activity - factor - Identifies the activity the subject performed;
  WALKING
  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  SITTING
  STANDING
  LAYING
